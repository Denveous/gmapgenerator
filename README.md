## Overview
This project is based around the initial code from Crow over on the [forums](https://forums.graalonline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=85656). This is designed to help you create gmap files & levels effortlessly. It generates the gmaps by either reading a `template.nw` file located in the same directory as the exe or a blank grass level if no `template.nw` is provided.
