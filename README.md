  <b>Gmap Generator</b>
  <br>
</h1>

## Overview
This project is based around the initial code from Crow over on the [forums](https://forums.graalonline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=85656). This is designed to help you create gmap files & levels effortlessly. It generates the gmaps by either reading a `template.nw` file located in the same directory as the exe or a blank grass level if no `template.nw` is provided.

### You can download the gmap generator [here](https://github.com/Denveous/gmapgenerator/releases/download/Windows/gmapgen.exe) or you can access the web version [here](https://denveous.github.io/gmapgenerator/).
